# Productivity Hub
## Purpose
Most productivity hub websites these days are too cluttered or too simple. To learn the basics of frontend, backend, full-stack, and APIs, I thought that it would be a good idea to build my own productivity hub.

## Materials
Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Backend: Python
Version Control: Git and GitHub
Other: VS Code
